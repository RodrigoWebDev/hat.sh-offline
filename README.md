# Hat.sh offline

This is an offline version of the [hat.sh](https://github.com/sh-dv/hat.sh) web app.

## How to use

Download this repository and open the index.html file in your favorite browser. I tested it on Chrome using Windows operating system.

## Why?

In the last few weeks, [hat.sh](https://github.com/sh-dv/hat.sh) has been offline, and because it is a crucial service for me and also because I was afraid that the service would simply stop existing and I would no longer be able to decrypt my files, I did this.
